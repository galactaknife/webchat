# webchat
Functional multi-room chat website.

Uses Python for back end (Flask framework).  

The Python connects to a MySQL database to manage data.

It also communicicates with PHP to manage user-uploaded files.

Uses SocketIO, GET, and POST requests to communicate between the client and back-end sides.

The client side uses JavaScript in order to both communicate to the server and manage the front-end behavior of the site.
